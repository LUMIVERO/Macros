# Set Gender of Persons

[[> Deutsche Version](readme.de.md)]

You have extended the first name database (see the Citavi Manual [Adding to the First Name Database](https://www1.citavi.com/sub/manual6/en/index.html?extending_the_name_database.html)) and now want to check the gender of people in an existing project against the new first name database.
However, the gender is only checked against the first name database for newly added people.
So all persons with unknown gender would have to be checked manually against the first name database.

## Solution

The macro provided here automates this task.
It checks all persons with unknown gender in the active project and adjusts the gender if necessary.

## Download

[for Citavi 6 and newer](C6+_Change_Gender_of_Authors.cs)
